The ErpBI.zip contains the Business Intelligence solution 
and pre-installed Pentaho community edition components.  A data mart database
is embedded and loaded with data from the PostBooks demo database. So you can 
quickly try the Web-based dashboards and pivot tables without having to install
PostBooks. 
  
See documentation in Installation.doc for installation instructions.  The 
install documentation can also be found in ErpBI\Docs.
